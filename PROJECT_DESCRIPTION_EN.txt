ZERTZ (Web)

Overview
- A browser implementation of the board game ZERTZ.
- Tech stack: React + TypeScript + Vite, Zustand for state management, IndexedDB for autosave.
- Rendering: SVG board with flat-top axial hex coordinates and a 37-ring layout.

Game Rules Implemented
- Two action types per turn:
  1) Placement:
     - Select a marble color from the reserve.
     - Place it on an empty ring.
     - Remove one removable ring (mandatory if available) and the turn ends.
  2) Capture (mandatory):
     - If any capture is available, the player must capture.
     - Capture works like checkers: jump over an adjacent marble to the empty ring directly behind it.
     - Multi-capture is mandatory: if further captures are available in the chain, the move must continue to the end.

Ring Removal Rules
- A ring can be removed only if:
  - It is empty.
  - It has at least two adjacent free edges (edge-of-board criterion).
- Isolation is allowed: removing a ring may disconnect the board.
  - If a disconnected group contains only marbles (no empty rings), all marbles in that group are captured.

Move History / Variations
- The game stores a move tree. Replaying to any move reconstructs the full game state.
- Variations are displayed immediately after the parent move (in parentheses).
- Navigation:
  - Click a move in the history.
  - Use ArrowLeft / ArrowRight.

Autosave / Load
- The current game is automatically saved to IndexedDB after every move.
- Main menu includes a “Load Game” dialog showing all saved games (finished and unfinished).

UI / UX
- Circular rings (visible even when a marble is on top).
- Board zoom (mouse wheel) implemented as camera zoom using SVG viewBox.
- Sound effects on key actions (place, remove ring, capture, win, undo).

Local Development
- Install dependencies and run:
  - npm install
  - npm run dev

Release (No installs on the friend’s PC)
- A static build can be found in the release/ folder.
- To run locally on Windows:
  - Double-click release/Start.cmd (or run Start.ps1)
  - Then open http://localhost:5173

Project Structure (high level)
- src/game/*: core rules/engine and board geometry.
- src/store/*: Zustand stores.
- src/components/*: UI components.
- src/db/*: IndexedDB utilities.
- release/*: built static files and a tiny PowerShell server script.
